  "summary": "On March 5, 1935, President Roosevelt made headlines by urging Congress to replace ocean mail contracts with direct subsidies for American shipping, aiming to strengthen the merchant marine. Internationally, Britain announced plans to increase its armed forces in response to perceived threats and the failure of disarmament pacts, while tensions continued in Greece with government forces routing Macedonian rebels. Economic news was dominated by the sharp decline in the value of the British pound, affecting commodity and stock markets worldwide. Domestically, the Supreme Court struck down parts of New York's milk control laws, and Congress debated major relief and infrastructure spending. Other notable stories included a murder case in Missouri unraveling when the supposed victim was found alive, and continued unrest in Mexico and Europe.",
