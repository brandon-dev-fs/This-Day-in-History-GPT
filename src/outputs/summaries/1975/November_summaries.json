  "summary": "On November 5, 1975, the nation saw significant political developments with women making historic gains as lieutenant governors in Kentucky and Mississippi. New York City's fiscal crisis dominated national discourse, with Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns expressing skepticism about federal aid despite polls showing most Americans believed a NYC default would have national economic consequences. President Ford's recent Cabinet shake-up continued to reverberate, with Vice President Rockefeller announcing he would campaign for Ford in 1976 despite removing himself from consideration as a running mate. In international news, Lebanon saw a fragile peace take hold in Beirut after weeks of factional fighting, while Spain's General Franco was in grave condition following surgery. Domestically, voters in New York and New Jersey rejected Equal Rights Amendments to their state constitutions, dealing a blow to the national ERA movement. The business world saw modest gains in the stock market and American auto sales increased for the first time in two years.",
