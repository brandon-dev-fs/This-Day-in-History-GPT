**Iraq Study Group Calls for New Approach to War**

The bipartisan Iraq Study Group released its highly anticipated report today, delivering a stark assessment of the situation in Iraq and recommending a fundamental change in U.S. strategy. The 10-member commission, led by former Secretary of State James Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton, presented their findings to President Bush and Congress before making them public.

The report described the situation in Iraq as "grave and deteriorating" with violence increasing and the Iraqi government failing to advance key issues of national reconciliation or provide basic security. It warned that "the ability of the United States to influence events is diminishing" despite committing nearly $400 billion and suffering almost 2,900 American deaths.

The commission's recommendations focus on three key areas: changing the primary mission of U.S. forces to enable a responsible withdrawal, setting clear milestones for the Iraqi government, and launching new diplomatic initiatives in the region, including direct engagement with Iran and Syria.
